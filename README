COMP40 HW4 - Arith

#Group members: Henning Shih (hshih 02)

#Total hours spent: ~50 (20 on analysis and design, 30 on implmentation)

#Assistance from TAs: 
Jordan Lueck, Ben, Byron, Noah, Michael, Sammy, Eloise, Leila, Sam  
Special thanks to Byron for catching a very confusing bug.

#Implmentation
All stages of compression work and  decompression word based on our testing. 
Bitpacking interface passes all of our own blocks with values calculated 
by hand.

The calculations in each module comply with the calculations as described in
the specifications to the best of our knowledge. However our final RGB values
are off by a noticeable margin. We suspect a large amount of precision and data
is lost in the inverse DCT stage given our Y values differ the most from
the original values in the compression stage.

Ppmdiff results for original vs compressed/decompressed image show a value
of ~0.3 for all test images, roughly a 30% difference. Some images perform
better and yield values under 0.26.
